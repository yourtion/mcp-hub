# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) service that acts as a centralized hub for managing multiple MCP servers. The service will register MCP servers from configuration files, organize them into logical groups, and provide functionality to discover and execute tools across different server groups. This enables users to interact with multiple MCP servers through a unified interface while maintaining proper organization and access control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure multiple MCP servers through JSON configuration files, so that I can manage server connections centrally without hardcoding server details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load MCP server configurations from `backend/config/mcp_server.json`
2. WHEN a server configuration includes a `command` and `args` THEN the system SHALL establish a stdio connection to that MCP server
3. WHEN a server configuration includes a `url` THEN the system SHALL establish an HTTP/SSE connection to that MCP server
4. IF a server configuration includes `env` variables THEN the system SHALL apply those environment variables when starting the server
5. WHEN a server is marked as `enabled: false` THEN the system SHALL skip initialization of that server
6. WHEN server initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other servers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize MCP servers into logical groups, so that I can control which tools are available for different use cases or user contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load group configurations from `backend/config/group.json`
2. WHEN a group configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL validate that all referenced servers exist in the MCP server configuration
3. WHEN a group specifies `servers` THEN only tools from those servers SHALL be available in that group context
4. WHEN a group specifies `tools` array THEN only those specific tools SHALL be available, filtered from the group's servers
5. IF a group's `tools` array is empty THEN all tools from the group's servers SHALL be available
6. WHEN group validation fails THEN the system SHALL log warnings but continue operation with valid groups

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to discover available tools within a specific group, so that I can understand what functionality is available before making tool calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request tools for a group THEN the system SHALL return a list of available tools with their schemas
2. WHEN I request tools for a non-existent group THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response
3. WHEN a group has no available tools THEN the system SHALL return an empty array
4. WHEN tool discovery fails for a server THEN the system SHALL exclude that server's tools but include others
5. WHEN I request tools without specifying a group THEN the system SHALL use the "default" group

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to execute tools from different MCP servers through group-based access, so that I can perform operations while respecting the configured access controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute a tool within a group context THEN the system SHALL verify the tool is available in that group
2. WHEN I execute a tool with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL forward the request to the appropriate MCP server
3. WHEN I execute a tool that doesn't exist in the group THEN the system SHALL return a "tool not found" error
4. WHEN tool execution fails on the MCP server THEN the system SHALL return the server's error response
5. WHEN I execute a tool without specifying a group THEN the system SHALL use the "default" group
6. WHEN tool execution succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the server's response unchanged

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the MCP service to handle connection failures gracefully, so that the system remains operational even when individual MCP servers are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP server connection fails during startup THEN the system SHALL continue initializing other servers
2. WHEN an MCP server becomes unavailable during operation THEN the system SHALL exclude its tools from group listings
3. WHEN attempting to execute a tool on an unavailable server THEN the system SHALL return a "server unavailable" error
4. WHEN an MCP server reconnects THEN the system SHALL automatically include its tools in group listings again
5. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling throughout the MCP service, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN servers are initialized THEN the system SHALL log successful connections and any failures
2. WHEN tools are discovered THEN the system SHALL log the count of tools found per server
3. WHEN tool execution occurs THEN the system SHALL log the tool name, group, and execution status
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages with context
5. WHEN configuration is reloaded THEN the system SHALL log the reload event and any changes detected
